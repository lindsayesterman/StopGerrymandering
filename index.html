	<h1> Let's Stop Gerrymandering!</h1>
		<h2>You have the power to stop gerrymandering! Do not let politicians waste your vote. </h2>
		<h3>Gerrymandering is the practice of distorting and manipulating the boundaries of electoral districts as a way to favor specific parties. It is basically cheating to gaurentee the same congressmen are back in office every election.</h3>

		<h3>We have made a letter for you to send to your local representative to help them consider voting against gerrymandering. All you have to do is sign your name and click send. We encourage you to make changes to the letter if you want to rephrase or add things! </h3>



		<label name="letterToRep">Letter To Representative:</label><br><br>
		<textarea name="textarea"
		rows="x" cols="x">Dear Representative,

I am sending this letter because I believe my vote should not be wasted. One of the most important parts of the politician’s campaign I’ll be voting for is their view on gerrymandering. Gerrymandering teaches our youth that it is OK to do immoral practices to get what they want. If you vote against gerrymandering and try to end this form of immorality, you will be much more likely to gain my vote in the upcoming election.

Consider voting against gerrymandering. I can assure you many more people will vote for you if you do. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
