   rows="x" cols="x">Dear Representative,

I am sending this letter because I believe my vote should not be wasted. One of the most important parts of the politician’s campaign I’ll be voting for, is their view on gerrymandering. Gerrymandering teaches our youth that it is OK to do immoral practices to get what they want. If you vote against gerrymandering and end this form of immorality, you can guarantee my vote in the upcoming election.

Consider voting against gerrymandering. I can assure my vote if you do. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
